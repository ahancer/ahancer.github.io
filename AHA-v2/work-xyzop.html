            <h2>Support Creators with Game Top up</h2>
            <img src="images/img-work-op-1.png" class="img-responsive main-image" alt="image">
            <p>OP Gamer is a platform that allows gamers to top up games while supporting their favorite creators or game casters. This project is owned by LnwTrue, a prominent game top up comapany in Thailand. They had experiemented with this
              concept and found a initial success. While there were still many movement parts with their concept, they wanted to tried it out with real market as soon as possible. They needed someone to collaborate with them in order to make their
              concept tangible, and that is why they came to Ahancer.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2>Design Deliverable</h2>
            <h3>UI Screen & Screenflow</h3>
            <p>Starting from scratch, we deliver UI screens and screen to the client in 6 weeks. While our focus was to design a mobile-frist website, we also delivered desktop-size design for certain key pages.</p>

            <img src="images/img-work-op-3.png" class="img-responsive main-image" alt="image">

            <h3>Style Guide</h3>
            <p>Besides delivering all the UI screens, screen flows, low-fidelity wireframes, and developer assets like illustrations and icons, we also provide a UI Style Guide that explains the usage and specification of various elements such as text, color, and component style. These guide allow developers to easily apply our UI design principles to any other future screens that they might need to design.</p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <h3>Project Type</h3>
            <p>For this project we spent a total of 2 weeks for the Discovery phase and 4 weeks for the Design phase.</p>
            <img src="images/img-work-op-5.png" class="img-responsive main-image" alt="image">


            <h3>Use wireframe for communication</h3>
            <p>We always begin communicating using wireframes as early as possible. Unlike traditional waterfall-based design and development where the company is left out of the loop, at Ahancer we leverage co-working sessions to collaborate with our clients to flush out what would be in each screen. This allows for greater flexibility since often times once our clients see the wireframes new better alternatives popup and we can capitalized on that. Using the real-time collaborative design software Figma, we help take concepts that are floating around and iron them out into a screen that we can prototype to test with actual users. </p>
            <img src="images/img-work-op-6.png" class="img-responsive main-image" alt="image">


            <h3>UI Theme</h3>
            <p>For the overall mood and feel of the OP Gamer website, its founder wanted it to feel powerful to live up to its name of OP (Over Power) but not in an aggresive way but more in a fun and exciting. Since OP aims to cater to not only the Thai market but also many other countries in South East Asia it was important the web looked international with a modern aesthetic typical of gaming gear websites. </p>
            <img src="images/img-work-op-7.png" class="img-responsive main-image" alt="image">
            <p>With these key attributes in mind, our team explored a variety of colors across both white and dark theme. Purple and black really achieved the desired mood and feel we wanted, so we decided to incorporate it into our main color pallete.</p>

Purple and black really achieved the desired mood and feel we wanted, so we decided to incorporate it into our main color pallete. Shown below is one of our early UI concepts drafts, as you can see the 2d illustrations were still low fidelity enough to get a general sense of guaging our visual direction.</p>
            <img src="images/img-work-op-9.png" class="img-responsive main-image" alt="image">



            <h3>User test along the way</h3>
            <p>Since this website was a platform that would be used by both gamers (who needed to top up for the games they are playing) as well as content creators (game casters), it was important that we tested our prototype with both user groups. Our user test served three main purposes:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Identify any usability issues early on so we can refine the design</li>
              <li>Develop a better understanding of our users painpoints and perspective</li>
              <li>Validate the viability of the OP concept website with actual users. </li>
            </ol>
            <img src="images/img-work-op-10.png" class="img-responsive main-image" alt="image">
            <p>It was also important that we got a diverse perspective from our users since the computer game category is massive. Therefore, it made sense for us to try to include users who played both MMO (Massive Multiplayer Online) as well as FPS (First Person Shooter) games since their behaviors were quite different.</p>
